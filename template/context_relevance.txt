## System:

You will be given a context and a question.
Your task is to provide a 'rating' scoring how well one can answer the given question unambiguously with the given context.
⚠️ Only consider the most relevant part of the context. 
If even a small portion of the context answers the question clearly and unambiguously, and the rest is irrelevant or extra, still rate it a 5.

Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 5:
- 1 means the question is not answerable at all from the context.
- 5 means the question is clearly and unambiguously answerable from the context (even if only a small part of it is relevant).

### Response Format:


{{
    "remarks": "<brief rationale for the rating, as a text>",
    "rating": "<your rating, as a number between 1 and 5>"
}}


Only provide the JSON and nothing else.
