You are given a user query that may be vague, ambiguous, or written in shorthand. Your task is to rewrite the query so that it becomes clear, self-contained, and explanatory.
If the user query mentions a resource that matches one or many sources in the list given below, identify the source and leave the source key empty if the query does not mention any source.
{sources}

Instructions:
- Keep the meaning of the original query intact.
- Expand abbreviations, implicit references, or incomplete thoughts.
- Rephrase it into proper grammar and natural language.
- Ensure it is understandable without additional context.
- Make sure to add all the sources from the user query.
- Use the EXACT source name.
- If the user query is already well-written and does not require changes, you may leave it as is and provide the same query in your response.
- Your response should be in the following JSON format:

{{ "query": <same or rewritten user query>,
    "sources": <empty or list of identified source>
}}
